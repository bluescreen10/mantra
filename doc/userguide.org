Mantra User Guide

* Introduction
Mantra is a multi-platform General Purporse Language inspired from several languages but mainly in Smalltalk and Perl. Mantra is a Prototype-oriented language.
Typically Object-oriented languages are built using Classes and Objects, in this paradigm objects are nothing but data structures that hold /state/ while classes hold the behavior. In languages like Smalltalk classes are also objects - instances of /Class/ object.

* Basic Syntax
** Hello World
Here is an example of "Hello World" program in Mantra.
\\
_HelloWorld__.__ma_
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#!mantra

System out: 'Hello World!\n'.
#+END_EXAMPLE
\\
This simple program sends the *out:* message to the global object *System* with the *Hello World!\n* string as parameter, and that prints /Hello World!/ in the console.
** Variables
*** Global variables
Variables defined outside of any block are global variables, that means that those variables are accessible by any block
